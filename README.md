# Online-Text-Editor
This online text editor provides users with a distraction free experience.


## Features

* Full page writing area
* Easily customizable color themes
* Dynamic word counter

### Full Page Writing Area

The entire page is devoted to the writing space. There is no formatting tool clutter so that writers can focus on jotting down their thoughts without being distracted by fancy formatting tools.

### Easily Customizable Color Themes

There is a color theme selector at the bottom. There are two input boxes - first one is for the text color, and second one is for the background color. You can either add HTML color codes (eg. #ffffff), or simply type in simple color names (eg. black).
The default is the white theme : white text on black background.
If you prefer the dark side, type black on the first input box and white and on the second input box and hit "Get New Theme" button. 


## Future Work

* Adding more tools for editors, such as bold, italics etc. while still being distraction free
* Option to select from pre-made themes
* Save features to download the text written as pdf, word, txt etc. formats.
